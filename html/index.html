  <h1>Captain Teach</h1>
  <p>Captain Teach is a peer review platform for computer science classrooms. It provides the facilities to create in-flow peer review workflows to meet the needs of various assignments.</p>

  <h2>What is In-Flow Peer Review?</h2>
  <p>Peer-review is a valuable tool that helps both the reviewee, who receives feedback about his work, and the reviewer, who sees different potential solutions and improves her ability to critique work. In-flow peer-review (IFPR) is peer-review done while an assignment is in progress. Peer-review done during this time is likely to result in greater motivation for both reviewer and reviewee.</p>

  <h2>Creating a Workflow</h2>
  <p>Captain Teach provides an easy to use point and click interface for defining workflows for your assignments. Each assignment is broken into a sequence of milestones which represents a student submission followed by peer review tasks which must be completed before the student can proceed to the next milestone.</p>

  <h2>Peer Review Interface</h2>
  <p>While performing peer review, students have access to a GitHub inspired file browser which provides syntax highlighting and the ability to leave in-line feedback. Additionally, an instructor provided review rubric is always present to help guide the review process.</p>

  <h2>Monitoring Progress</h2>
  <p>A happy consequence of in-flow peer review is that it forces students to work on intermediate milestones for the duration of an assignment; they cannot scramble to finish everything the night before it is due. Captain Teach provides a dashboard for instructors to monitor the progress of the whole class as well as individual students. The instructor can quickly check that students are engaged and completing milestones on time, and debug any issues that may arise. </p>

  <p>The assignment overview displays the number of students who need to submit to each milestone, the number of completed reviews, and the number of students who have actually viewed their feedback. If these numbers are low, it indicates that students are not engaged. It could be that they've received several poor-quality reviews or that they received reviews that were too late to be useful and are now disinterested in the peer review process. By discovering these issues early an instructor is able to respond to the needs of their students. </p>

  <p>In addition to a quick overview, the dashboard provides a detailed view of each milestone. This view provides staff with quick access to individual submissions and reviews. By spending a few minutes browsing through student submissions on an early milestone, staff may notice a common error among the submissions that should be addressed. For example, an assignment write-up may have been unintentionally misleading or simply incorrect. Similarly, a quick glance at several student reviews might reveal a rubric question is not having the desired effect. These kinds of errors can be swiftly corrected due to the visibility that Captain Teach provides. We have found this early feedback very useful in our courses.</p>
