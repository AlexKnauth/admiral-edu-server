# Captain Teach

This repository contains the Racket Captain Teach server.

This code is organized to be used as a Racket package. You can install it using

```
raco pkg install admiral-edu-server
```

You might be interested in running Captain Teach. If so, this repo is just
a part of the picture. You should instead be looking at the "main" repo that
uses this one, admiral-edu.
