;; this file is about regression testing, with the lightest possible
;; layer of actual correctness testing. Specifically, it makes a bunch
;; of requests and prints out the results, but it also checks that the
;; status codes are what they should be.

;; there are also a few tests that look for specific XSS attacks, by
;; checking to see whether the given tag can be made to appear in
;; the output.
